# Node.js Best Practices Guide

## Introduction
Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that enables server-side JavaScript execution. This guide covers essential best practices for building robust Node.js applications.

## Project Structure

### Folder Organization
Organize your Node.js project with clear separation of concerns:
```
src/
├── controllers/    # Route handlers
├── services/       # Business logic
├── models/         # Data models
├── middleware/     # Express middleware
├── utils/          # Utility functions
└── config/         # Configuration files
```

## Error Handling

### Async/Await Error Handling
Always wrap async operations in try-catch blocks:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const result = await database.query();
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Database query failed:', error);
    throw new CustomError('Failed to fetch data', 500);
  }
}
```

### Global Error Handler
Implement a global error handler for Express applications to catch unhandled errors and provide consistent error responses.

## Performance Optimization

### Use Node.js Cluster
Utilize all CPU cores by implementing clustering:
```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  startServer();
}
```

### Implement Caching
Use Redis or in-memory caching to reduce database load and improve response times. Cache frequently accessed data with appropriate TTL values.

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
Always validate and sanitize user input using libraries like Joi or express-validator to prevent injection attacks.

### Use Environment Variables
Store sensitive configuration in environment variables, never commit secrets to version control.

### Implement Rate Limiting
Protect your APIs from abuse by implementing rate limiting using packages like express-rate-limit.

## Testing

### Unit Testing
Write comprehensive unit tests using Jest or Mocha. Aim for at least 80% code coverage.

### Integration Testing
Test API endpoints using Supertest to ensure your application behaves correctly end-to-end.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Structured Logging
Use structured logging with libraries like Winston or Pino for better log analysis and debugging.

### Application Monitoring
Implement APM (Application Performance Monitoring) using tools like New Relic or DataDog to track performance metrics and errors in production.

## Database Best Practices

### Connection Pooling
Always use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently and prevent connection exhaustion.

### Query Optimization
- Use indexes on frequently queried columns
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use projection to fetch only required fields

## Deployment

### Use PM2 for Process Management
PM2 provides process management, automatic restarts, and load balancing for Node.js applications in production.

### Implement Health Checks
Create health check endpoints to monitor application status and integrate with load balancers.
